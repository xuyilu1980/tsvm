# tsvm
The svm and tsvm algorithms for brain-computer interface. Our algorithms are tested in Matlab 2015a.

The directories are the following:

(1) Classifier:

tsvm_classifier.m: the script of SVM, TSVM-light, RTSVM, LDS, CCCP, and ITSVM.
isttsvm_classifier.m: the script of IST-TSVM 

(2) EEGdata:
a) BCI competition III data set IVa: You can download this set at http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/.
b) BCI competition IV data set IIa: You can download this set at http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/.

(3) functions:
Various usefull toolbox. Noted that before running matlab, you should install C compiler, for example: Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Professional (C).

(4) GeneratedData:
The results were saved in this folder.

(5) Utilities:
Small matlab source code file.
